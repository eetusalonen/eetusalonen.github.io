                    <p>
                        I’m ambitious and driven person who doesn’t say no for a challenge. I always try to find new ways to improve myself, and I thrive at solving problems with a creative mindset. I’m the kind of guy who knows how to get things done, while having some fun on the way.  I’m intrigued about technology and marketing  which I have learned from my studies and previous work experience.  While I consider myself as  business and results-oriented I also enjoy doing creative work.

                    <p>
                        I started working at Funzi as a summer intern. My role was to support in B2C Marketing which consisted of Facebook advertising, Lead generation, Lead analysis and market research. I had some earlier experience with Facebook Ads but at Funzi I learned many different techniques from copywriting and creatives to experimenting with different objectives. Lead generations included live-sessions in South-Africa to engage with leads in messenger, to find out their learning motives and challenges. After multiple sessions with various different questions, we conducted an analysis to find similarity in the answers. I also got hands on experience about market research for new potential countries.

                    <p>
                        As the summer internship ended I contienued as a growth and marketing trainee. My work has consisted of various different tasks like SEO, Fake door campaigns, WhatsApp marketing, Facebook marketing and Lead management.

                    <p>
                        SEO:  I perfomed keyword search to find suitable keywords for different courses. After the search I build a “wordbank” for keywords to make them easily available between different teams. We also conducted a Guide to SEO for each team to make our efforts more consistent. My task was to do research behind the guide which meant going through many articles and blogs to find out the most relevant information. Then I gathered the information to a document which was used as a foundation for the guidlines.

                    <p>
                        WhatsApp Marketing: Experimenting with growing but underutilized platform to engage with leads on WhatsApp. Testing different approaches to get the best outcome. Analyzing the results from Google Analytics (CAC, Course starts, Course completions etc.), to see if the platform would be worth to invest in.

                        Fake door campaigns: Executing fake door campaigns to determine right prices for new markets together with the growth team. I was in charge of cretives, copies and setting up the facebook campaigns. Also involved in planning and analyzing the results.

                <h5>Sales / Yinfoods</h5>
                <p>
                    Taking part in process of creating health product importing to be part of the business. After settling an agreement of importing prices with the manufacturer it was time to kick off the sales process. First, I got the product to few minor stores but after some denials I got a meeting with the biggest Finnish health product chain and now the products are sold across Finland. I’m taking care of sales, invoicing and account relationships.

                <h5>Marketing / Studio Yin Online (online.studioyin.com) </h5>
                <p>
                    For the online yoga platform I designed different landing pages, live stream page and connected different tools together for tracking (Google Analytics, - Tag Manager, -Ads).  I worked with optimizing PPC campaigns and conducted A/B testing for landing pages. Also helped with social media marketing.
